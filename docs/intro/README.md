## Best Practices
* ### Free Thought

* ### Documentation
Documenting your thinking process is vital for a consistent r and d process. This help the thinker to flush out their ideas, by having them explain them. This also helps others by inspiring them to think about other ideas. People outside of the initial ideation phase will feel more welcomed and informed if we have great documentation.
