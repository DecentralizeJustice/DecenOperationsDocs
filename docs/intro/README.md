## Why Open Source a Business Plan
There are several reasons that an open source business plan fits Multisig Crypto so well.

### Public Service
We believe that our services and products are a human right. The best way to accomplish this level of
accessibility our goal is to one day have this business be ran as a dao. Being open lays the
seeds for this goal.
### No Secret Sauce
There is no secret sauce to being successful. The only way to be successful in a long term manner is to execute a good plan for several years. We do not fear any competitors executing our plan, because any companies' biggest enemy is themselves, not any competitors.
### Empty Promises
The blockchain space is filled with a bunch of forked repos and empty promises. They promise you they will solve all the worlds problems but cant explain how. We hate empty promises and vapor wear. This is an attempt to avoid all of that and layout a clear plan of action.
### Feedback
No one company could ever compete with the intelligence and cleverness of the entire world. With an open source plan, we can get feedback and harness the power of the crowd to make a better product for our amazing customers.
### Everyone Knows Already
Most people know what they should do, but lack the execution. Everyone knows that eating unhealthy food will lead to having an unhealthy body. This is a fact that everyone knows but people still eat unhealthy food. The same can be said for companies. Everyone CEO knows that they should stay up to date and constantly iterate their products, but they don't. Knowing what to do is relatively straight forward, but execution is the hard part.
### Transparency
We aim to be radically open in all that we do, and this plan only builds upon that goal.
