# Decentralize Justice Brand

## For the People by the People
We believe in proving services and products that the average person can use. This shows in two main ways:
### Keep Everything Affordable
We could design products that catered to rich people, but we instead choose to design things that are finically accessible for most people. We have no interest in the the rich richer with crypto. Our goal is to help people leverage the power of cryptography to build a better future.
### Empower People
We build products that empower our members to have more power of their lives. We design our products to avoid vendor lock and to not require us to continue on as normal. Do to the open source nature of our organization our legacy will exist far beyond us.


## 100% Equity
We will not allow people with money to have an unfair say so in our company. We will stay 100% members focused and that requires us to not trade control of our company for money.
